# House-Price-Prediction
## Problem Statement
House price prediction is a common problem in the real estate industry. The goal is to predict the selling price of a house based on various features and attributes. This problem is typically approached as a regression problem, where the target variable is the price of the house, and the features are various attributes of the house.

Accurate predictions can benefit real estate agents and appraisers in pricing homes correctly. Homeowners can also use the predictions to set a reasonable asking price for their properties. Additionally, buyers can make informed decisions about purchasing a property and obtaining a fair price for their investment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about houses and their attributes. It includes the following columns:

Dataset Link : <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NtOKehSz8SiVnk0cPZX5TFndug4SYL5T/view"> Download Dataset</a>

- Price: The prices of the houses
- Area: The area of the houses
- Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in each house
- Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in each house
- Stories: The number of stories in each house
- Main Road: Whether the house is connected to the main road (yes/no)
- Guestroom: Whether the house has a guest room (yes/no)
- Basement: Whether the house has a basement (yes/no)
- Hot Water Heating: Whether the house has hot water heating (yes/no)
- Air Conditioning: Whether the house has air conditioning (yes/no)
- Parking: The number of parking spaces available in each house
- Furnishing Status: The furnishing status of each house

## Approach

To solve the house price prediction problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data, check for missing values, and visualize the relationships between variables.
3. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding), and scaling numerical features if necessary.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Select an appropriate regression model, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, or gradient boosting regression.
6. Train the regression model using the training data.
7. Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score.
8. Optionally, you can tune the hyperparameters of the chosen regression model to improve its performance.
9. Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Conclusion
In this project, we addressed the problem of house price prediction using a regression approach. By analyzing the provided dataset, performing data preprocessing, training a regression model, and evaluating its performance, we aimed to create a model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features and attributes.

The successful deployment of such a model can assist real estate agents, homeowners, and buyers in making informed decisions regarding house prices. However, it's important to note that the accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality and relevance of the features used, as well as the chosen regression model.

Feel free to explore the provided code and adapt it to your specific needs. Happy house price prediction!
